When you're figuring out how to start a blog, a vital step to designing a successful one is choosing the right theme.

Your theme is the overall look, feel, and style of your website. This includes things like the color scheme, layout, and style elements. In essence, your website theme is a direct representation of your brand and has a direct impact on your users' experience.

With thousands of themes to choose from, the process of selecting the right theme for your blog can become overwhelming. Thankfully, you can use the WordPress feature filter to narrow down your search.

The theme filter feature allows you to sort by subject (in this case, you'll want a blog theme), as well as the layout and other important design aspects.

- Custom Background
- Custom Logo
- Flexible Header
- Front Page Posting

- Sticky Post
- Translation Ready
Once you've found the perfect theme for your blog, it's time to start customizing it, so it stands out from the crowd as uniquely yours.
